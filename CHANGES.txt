Changelog
=========

2.0 (2017-03-21)
----------------

- Use python package lesscpy directly instead of calling a script (#8).
  This allows to get rid of Node.js in buildout for server-side compiling.
  [laulaz]

- Add (optional) minification of LESS files.
  Code is based on https://github.com/collective/collective.lesscss/pull/9 but
  uses lessc script directly (instead of cleancss) with compress option.
  [laulaz]

- Improve server-side compilation when there are references between files.
  We need to compile the resources all together because otherwise the compiler
  will fail on unknown variables references between files.
  [laulaz]
